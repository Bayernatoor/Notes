Ex 23 LPTHW - Notes:
-----------

Encodings:


bit = 1s and 0s

byte = 8 bits ( 1s and 0s)

Other conventions may use 16, 32, 64 - for really big math problems.

Bytes can then be used to map a number to a letter. 

The most popular is ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange 
   - Number 90 = Z, which in bits = 1011010. 
   
In Python: 
>>> 0b1011010
90
>>> ord ( ’ Z ’ )
90
>>> chr ( 9 0 )
’Z ’
